**Mile High Hacks** is a **hackathon** that will bring
over 100 high schoolers from Denver and the surrounding regions
together for 24 hours to design, invent, code, and build apps and
games. Mile High Hacks is designed for all experience levels, whether
you've never written code before or have been coding for years.
On Saturday, you'll get matched into a team of four
people to build a project with - or bring a team of friends! On the
Sunday, our judges will select the winning teams to demo their
projects and earn prizes!
