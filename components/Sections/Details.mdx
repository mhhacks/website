**Mile High Hacks** is a **hackathon** that will bring
around 100 high schoolers from Denver and the surrounding regions
together for 24 hours to design, invent, code, and build apps,
games and more. Mile High Hacks is designed for all experience levels, whether
you've never written code before or have been coding for years.
On Saturday, you'll get matched into a team of four
people to spend the weekend building a project with - or bring a team of friends! On the
Sunday, our judges will select the winning teams to demo their
projects and earn prizes! At Mile High Hacks, you can expand your skills, make new friends, and create something creative or valuable!
