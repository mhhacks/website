### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is a fun event where students work together to brainstorm, code, design, and present projects, such as apps, websites, and hardware. At MAHacks, you can expand your skills, make new friends, and create something valuable! **No, we aren't destructively "hacking" servers or databases** - in this context, the word "hacking" means building things using code. MAHacks is safe, supervised, and educational.

<div>

### Who can attend MAHacks?

**High schoolers from any school** are welcome! Middle school students are allowed on a case-by-case basis, reach out to us at [team@mahacks.com](mailto:team@mahacks.com). We do not allow parents, teacher chaperones, or college students at the event.

### How much will it cost?

**Nothing.** There will be workshops, prizes, merch, food, and fun, all at zero cost to you! Unfortuantely, we cannot reimburse participant's travel expenses at this time.

### What if I don't know how to code?

Everyone is welcome at MAHacks! **We'll have workshops for everyone who's willing to learn**, even if you're just getting started or are a pro-super-ninja-hacker!

### What can I make?

**Anything!** Your project can be a website, app, robot, or anything else you can come up with and build!

### What should I bring?

You will need a laptop and charger, and anything else you want to hack on. **Make sure to bring your ID (preferably government issued) and proof of vaccination**! You may be notified of other required documents, such as the waiver, closer to the event. Most importantly, bring a willingness to learn and have fun!

### What about COVID?

We'll be following all CDC and state guidelines for events. N95-type masks will be required and provided. We're looking to provide COVID testing to attendees (if you can help, please reach out!).

### I'm a college student/professional interested in getting involved. Can I mentor?

We are looking for college students and professionals skilled in software, mobile, or hardware development, graphic design, marketing, project management, or any area useful for hackathon participants. Mentors are free to work with multiple teams and guide them through issues, technical or otherwise, they're facing. If you are interested in mentoring, please reach out to team@mahacks.com.

### Who's running this? Is it supervised?

MAHacks is independently organized by a team of high schoolers, for high schoolers. We will have adult supervisors with background checks on site for the duration of the event, and will be working with building security and local law enforcement to ensure all participants' safety.  **If you have any questions or concerns about the safety of the event, please email team@mahacks.com**.
