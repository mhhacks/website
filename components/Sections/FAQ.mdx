<summary>What is a hackathon? What's involed?</summary>

A hackathon is a fun event where students work together to brainstorm, design, code, and present projects, such as apps, websites, and hardware. You'll spend most of the weekend attending workshops and working with your team to develop a website, app, game, robot, or something else. We'll also have times for food and games. Finally, on Sunday morning, you'll have the chance to present your project to our judges and other teams and win prizes.

<summary>Hacking? Is that safe?</summary>

**No, we aren't destructively "hacking" servers or databases** - in this context, the word "hacking" means building things using code. Mile High Hacks is safe, educational, and 100% legal.

Everyone is welcome at Mile High Hacks! **We'll have workshops for everyone who's willing to learn**.
