# MAHacks Code of Conduct

MAHacks' participants include people from many different backgrounds. The MAHacks team is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristics.

This Code of Conduct applies on location at the event, and it also applies to any online communication between participants before, after and during the event.

## TL;DR
- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don't be destructive or inflammatory.
- If you encounter an issue, please contact team@mahacks.com or talk to someone with an organizer t-shirt.

People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Communicate with patience, respect and thoughtfulness. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## Harassment

We have a strict anti-harassment policy. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:

- Harmful verbal comments or discrimination related to race, color, religion, gender, gender expression, age, national origin, disability, education, or sexual orientation.
- Sexual images in public spaces.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Harassing photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

## Disruptive behavior

Beside harassment, disruptive behavior is not permitted. Examples of this can include:

- Making unwanted loud noises during activities.
- Repeatedly derailing conversations.
- Providing unconstructive criticism or insults.
- Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing or disruptive behavior are expected to comply immediately.

**Event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from MAHacks**.

## Reporting issues

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Do not post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a particular individual or group. Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of MAHacks for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event.

You can contact us by sending an email to team@mahacks.com or talking to someone wearing an organizer t-shirt at the event. We'll be happy to help you contact venue security, law enforcement, support services, or other assist you to feel safe for the duration of MAHacks.
